# DataWarehouse-Issues
The SmarterApp Data Warehouse and Reporting System collects student assessment results and produces reports for authorized users. The source code for Data Warehouse and Reporting is licensed to Smarter Balanced Member States and their contracted service providers. The code will be released under an open license in the Fall of 2016. Until then, the code is stored in a private GitHub repository.

This public repository is a placeholder primarily for the collection of issues (bug reports and enhancement requests) associated with the data warehouse.
